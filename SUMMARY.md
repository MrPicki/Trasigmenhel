## Testing Locally

Before deploying, you can test the production build locally:

```bash
# Windows
test-build.bat

# Mac/Linux
npx serve dist
```

This will serve your production build on http://localhost:5000 so you can verify everything works correctly.

## Future Updates

Whenever you want to update your website:

1. Make your changes to the code
2. Test locally with `npm run dev`
3. Build and deploy with `npm run deploy`

Your website is now ready to be deployed to GitHub Pages with your custom domain!
